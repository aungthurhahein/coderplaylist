This project is hosted @ <a href="http://aungthurhahein.github.io/coderplaylist">coderplaylist</a>. 


This is just a curation of playlists by coders and programmers. Right now, I started putting playlists I used to listen while I am working.

At this moment, there are only three music services I mostly used; Spotify, 8 tracks and youtube.

For contribution, pull request this repo and put more services and playlists.

Happy coding and listening great music!
